            <h1>Why Messi is Better</h1>
            <p>Lionel Messi is widely regarded as one of the most naturally gifted football players in the history of
                the sport. His vision, dribbling, playmaking ability, and consistency on the field give him an edge over
                most players, including Cristiano Ronaldo. Messi's ability to control a game from midfield, combined
                with his unmatched dribbling, allows him to break down even the strongest defenses.</p>
